# Hello Sass
Use this git repository to have a starting point for Sass when working locally
<br/><br/>

## Usage
Clone this git repo to your local machine
```git clone https://github.com/YarivGilad/hello-sass.git```

then install all dependencies ```npm i```

To run the project locally during development run ```npm start```

To build the project before you deploy to production run ```npm run build```

After the build you may want to run the dist folder files locally with ```npx serve dist```

This will also conveniently reveal the local IP of your machine so you can test it on a mobile device using the same wifi network...

You can use the same local IP address to also connect to **parcel** 
while developing <br>by switching from port `3000` to port `1234`
<br/><br/>
## Deployment

You can use [Netlify drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) for hosting your static website
or alternatively try [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
